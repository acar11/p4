## Description
 This is a list of things we must do and we just forget because of our busy
 schedule or lifestyle.

 Our brain is full to its capacity most of the time and to remember
 all these little things, its just tough, right?
 In this version of the "Tasks'n Things to Remember Management", our list can help, it will be color coded to show how the dates are progressing as far as being on time, or if a task is about to be due.
 The reason for the colors is to help you not to focus too much on reading just plain dates, but to instruct your subconscious mind that something is about to be due
 and ready to be completed, hoping that it's something fun!

 In the next version of the "Tasks'n Things to Remember Management", a reminder choice of text message, email will be included.

 Your timezone will automatically be set, location reminder will be also included on the next  version.
